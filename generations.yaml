    description: "The first-generation MINI Countryman marked a significant expansion of the MINI brand, introducing the marque's first crossover SUV and first four-door model. Substantially larger than any previous MINI at approximately 4.1 meters long, it offered genuine five-passenger seating and significantly more cargo space. Built on a dedicated platform, it featured raised ground clearance, more upright styling, and available ALL4 all-wheel drive system. Powertrains included naturally aspirated and turbocharged 1.6-liter engines in Cooper and Cooper S models respectively, with diesel options (Cooper D, One D, Cooper SD) available in European markets. The interior maintained MINI's distinctive styling cues including the large central speedometer and toggle switches, with innovative features like the MINI Centre Rail system between the seats for adaptable storage. Despite its larger dimensions, the Countryman preserved much of MINI's characteristic handling dynamics while adding practicality and mild off-road capability. Early models included Cooper S, Cooper S ALL4, Cooper, One, Cooper D, Cooper D ALL4, and One D."
