    description: "The first-generation MINI Countryman marked a significant expansion of the MINI brand, introducing the marque's first crossover SUV and first four-door model. Substantially larger than any previous MINI at approximately 4.1 meters long, it offered genuine five-passenger seating and significantly more cargo space. Built on a dedicated platform, it featured raised ground clearance, more upright styling, and available ALL4 all-wheel drive system. Powertrains mirrored the standard MINI lineup, including naturally aspirated and turbocharged 1.6-liter engines in Cooper and Cooper S models respectively, with a high-performance John Cooper Works variant added in 2012 producing 211 horsepower (later increased to 218 hp). European markets also received various diesel options. The interior maintained MINI's distinctive styling cues including the large central speedometer and toggle switches, but with a more rugged character and innovative features like the MINI Centre Rail system between the seats for adaptable storage. Despite its larger dimensions, the Countryman preserved much of MINI's characteristic handling dynamics while adding practicality and mild off-road capability. A plug-in hybrid prototype called the Countryman E was tested but never entered production. A mild refresh in 2014 brought subtle styling updates and refinements to the powertrain and features. The first-generation Countryman successfully expanded MINI's appeal to families and lifestyle-oriented buyers, becoming one of the brand's bestselling models globally."

    description: "The second-generation Countryman grew significantly larger, increasing by approximately 20 cm in length and 3 cm in width, positioning it squarely in the compact crossover segment. Built on BMW's UKL2 platform shared with the BMW X1, it featured more sophisticated underpinnings and technology while maintaining MINI's distinctive design elements. The expanded dimensions provided noticeably increased passenger space and cargo capacity, with rear seats that could slide and recline. Powertrain options included a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder in the Cooper (134 hp), a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder in the Cooper S (189 hp, later increased to 192 hp), and a high-performance 2.0-liter with 228 hp (later increased to 301 hp) in the John Cooper Works model. A significant addition was the Cooper S E Countryman ALL4 plug-in hybrid, combining the 1.5-liter engine with an electric motor for a total system output of 221 horsepower and an electric-only range of approximately 12-24 miles depending on the model year. The ALL4 all-wheel drive system was available on most variants and standard on the JCW and plug-in hybrid. The interior featured a more mature design with improved materials quality, enhanced technology including an available 8.8-inch touchscreen with navigation, and a more conventional layout with the speedometer relocated to the driver's instrument cluster. Advanced safety features expanded to include automated emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and parking assistance. A refresh in 2020 brought styling updates, improved technology, and more efficient powertrains. The second-generation Countryman successfully balanced MINI's distinctive character with increased versatility and refinement, appealing to buyers seeking a premium compact crossover with personality."

    description: "The third-generation Countryman continues its growth trajectory, increasing by approximately 13 cm in length and 6 cm in height compared to its predecessor, becoming the largest MINI model ever produced. Built on BMW's FAAR platform shared with the latest BMW X1, it offers both combustion and all-electric powertrain options for the first time. The exterior design evolves with a more angular, upright appearance featuring rectangular headlights (a departure from MINI's traditional round units), a more pronounced and squared-off grille, and a bolder overall presence while maintaining recognizable MINI design cues. Combustion engine options include a 1.5-liter three-cylinder in the Cooper C producing 168 horsepower, a 2.0-liter four-cylinder generating 215 horsepower in the Cooper S, and a 2.0-liter with 296 horsepower in the John Cooper Works model. The electric Countryman E features a single motor with 187 horsepower and approximately 250 miles of range, while the SE ALL4 offers dual motors producing 268 horsepower combined and all-wheel drive capability. The interior adopts MINI's new minimalist approach with a large circular OLED display in the center of the dashboard, reduced physical controls, and new sustainable material options including a leather-free interior. Advanced technology includes augmented reality navigation, enhanced driver assistance systems, and a sophisticated ambient lighting system that extends across the dashboard. Despite its increased size and more mainstream crossover proportions, the new Countryman maintains distinctive MINI design elements and driving character while offering significantly enhanced practicality, technology, and electrification options, positioning it to compete more directly with premium compact SUVs."
